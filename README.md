## Project Structure

This app is built following a modular approach, organizing the code by feature (Movies, Series, etc.), and leveraging best practices for scalable React applications.

## Features

- Display a list of trending and top rated movies (or series)
- View detailed information about each movie on a dedicated page

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-app.git
````

2. Navigate into the project directory:

````bash
cd movie-app
````

3. Install the dependencies:

````bash
npm install
# or if using yarn
yarn install
````

### Running the Project
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app locally:

````bash
npm start
# or if using yarn
yarn start
````

This will start the development server. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app. 5. API Integration
The app uses an external API to fetch movies and series data. You can replace the API_BASE_URL and API_KEY in src/utils/config.ts with your own API endpoint.

### API Integration
````bash
export const API_BASE_URL: string | undefined =
"https://api.themoviedb.org/3";
export const API_KEY: string | undefined = <your_api_key>;

````

This will start the development server. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
